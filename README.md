# Garbage-Classification-using-CNNs
---
- Garbage Classification into Organic or Recyclable using a Sequential Deep Learning model from Keras library of Tensorflow to promote sustainable management techniques of waste disposal.
- Data processing using image generators were carried out before fitting the model.
- Different sequentital models with different hyperparameters were trained and evaluated to check for best possible solution.
